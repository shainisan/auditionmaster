ðŸŽµðŸŽ» Excited to share a unique project that fuses my passions for music and technology!

As a former professional symphony orchestra musician, Iâ€™ve faced the rigors of preparing for auditions firsthand. Inspired by this, Iâ€™ve created a tool to aid fellow musicians in honing their technical skills for orchestral auditions.

The app Iâ€™ve built allows musicians to upload or record a performance excerpt. It then analyzes the recording, providing crucial performance metrics such as tempo, volume, clarity, and tuning, displayed through numerical scores and time-series graphs. Users can even watch their musical progress unfold on these metric plots as the recording plays in the app.

While the app offers valuable insights, itâ€™s important to note that the interpretation of the results rests with the musician. The app provides an objective analysis but doesnâ€™t discern artistic intention. It informs you if a part was loud, out of tempo, or out of tune, but you decide how these insights apply to your unique style and interpretive choices. This makes the tool a personal journey of improvement, with scores primarily intended for self-comparison over time.

Built on Flask and powered by the Librosa library for music and audio analysis, the UI was designed using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and ChatGPT, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

I believe this app can transform how musicians prepare for auditions. Check out the attached demo video and dive into the full code in my portfolio. Hereâ€™s to empowering musicians with tech! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¹
